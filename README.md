# Project Reddit

I created this project for [Parsity's](https://parsity.io/) software engineering bootcamp curriculum. I was evaluated on my ability to create a frontend and dynamically manipulate it using the Document Object Model (DOM).

I built this project using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap 5, and a minor amount of custom CSS.

## Features

- Write and submit a post, which then appears in the forum section above the input fields.
- Open a collapsible comment section for each post and leave a comment if you choose.
- Delete posts and comments.
- Edit posts after they have been posted.
